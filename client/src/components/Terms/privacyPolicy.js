    </b>
You, or an authorized agent (where applicable), can exercise these rights with respect to one or more of our signature services as provided under the Contact Us section below and to the extent applicable to you under the respective US State Laws. In order to exercise your rights, we may have to verify your identity. We will do this by asking you to provide us with certain information we already have to confirm your identity.

Authorized agents, where applicable, will be required to provide proof of their authorization and we may also require that you directly verify their identity and the authority of the authorized agent.
<br></br>We recognize and support the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) standard. As such, if you enabled your browser or device to broadcast a GPC signal, we will automatically process it upon receival as a valid request to opt out of the sale and sharing of your Personal Information.

    Special Disclosures for California Residents<br></br>
Shine the Light:
    </b>
    As a California resident, you may request, once a year and free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed Personal Information (if any) for their own direct marketing purposes. See the Contact Us section below for how to make this request. However, note we do not share your Personal Information with third parties for their own marketing purposes without your express consent. Accordingly, you can prevent the type of sharing by withholding consent or opting out of sharing of Personal Information as further described on the Notice of Right to Opt Out section below.
</li>
<li>
    <b>Notice of Right to Opt Out:</b>
    We do not sell your Personal Information in exchange for money. However, like many ecommerce companies, we do share your Personal Information with third parties, such as our advertising partners to help show relevant ads based on your interests. If you would like to learn more, or wish to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Information, please see the Contact Us section below. Please note that we do not knowingly sell or share the Personal Information of individuals under the age of 16 years old.

    <b>Notice of Financial Incentive</b>
    In some instances, we may offer various types of incentives in exchange for the collection of your Personal Information, such as discounts, promotional codes, prices as part of a sweepstake entry or contest, participation in surveys, exclusive offers when you sign up to receive our marketing emails and other programs. The amount and terms of such incentives will be presented to you at the time of the offer or program. When you participate in or sign up for one of these offers or programs, we collect Personal Information from you, such as identifiers like your name, email address and/or phone number.
    <br></br>
    Because these activities involve the collection of Personal Information as well as the offering of various benefits, they might be interpreted as providing a “financial incentive” under California law. To the extent that we derive value from the collection of your Personal Information, we reasonably estimate the value of the financial incentive to be equal to the value we receive from the Personal Information collected. We estimate the value of a consumer’s Personal Information by directly relating it to the expenses which might be incurred in the provision of each incentive and the collection, storage, and use of such Personal Information in the operation of our business.
    <br></br>
    Participation in our financial incentives is voluntary. You may opt into a financial incentive by following the sign-up or participation instructions provided, and you have the ability to opt out or withdraw at any time by unsubscribing from our marketing communications or terminating the participation in the sweepstake or contest prospectively by following the instructions in the applicable terms.
    <br></br>
    We do not offer financial incentives that are unjust, unreasonable, coercive, or usurious in nature. If you have any questions about our financial incentives, please contact us as indicated under the Contact Us section below.
